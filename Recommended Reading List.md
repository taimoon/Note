Read a lot.

How to read a book - Charles Van Doren and Mortimer J. Adler


# Computer Science
1. Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, 2nd ed.
   
   For programming, I would recommend only one book : SICP.

   Harvard's cs50x is by far the best CS for general audience. Although SICP is created as introduction to CS, it is notoriously difficult, dense, somewhat "outdated" and hated by many. It is desigend during 1980s and the choice of language Scheme only make it worst. 
   
   It covers many important concepts such as algorithm analysis, data abstraction, functional programming, object oriented programming, stream, concurrency, interpreter (chapter 4), lazy-evaluation, non-determinsitc programming, logic programming and compiler (chapter 5). 

   Why SICP? Because unlike other courses only teach you well verse of certain specific programming language and technology, SICP teaches you about CS itself. It delivers fundementals in the most intellectually fun way. The practices of SICP are not drill but provoke you to think carefully. Anyway, isn't designing programming language cool? SICP teach you that.

# Mathematics
For starter, Khan Academy is great enough all of high school math including basic Calculus and Statistic.

What if you're math lover wishing to appreciate advance math but not able to join pure math track or found pure math track too hard? I propose a roadmap that's more gentle. First, read discrete math until you know how to understand and write proof, then you can pick other subjects in any order you want.

1. Discrete Math
   1. How to Prove It: A Structured Approach by Daniel J. Velleman
   2. Discrete Mathematics with Applications - Susanna S. Epp
2. Abstract Algebra
   1. A First Course in Abstract Algebra - Joseph J. Rotman
   2. Contemporary Abstract Algebra - Joseph A. Gallian
   
        Personally, abstract algebra introduction is a better first proof writing course than mathematical analysis because abstract algebra is more intuitive than mathematical analysis. abstract algebra don't have specific prerequisite but demand mathematical maturity and comfortable with proof. Abstract algebra has applications in cryptography, information theory, functional programming (i.e.: monads) and deep learning frontier. 
        
        Abstract algebra studies group, ring and field. For pure math student, the milestones include Langrange's Theorem, fundemental theorem of finite abelian groups, and Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory
3. Introduction to Mathematical Statistics and Its Applications - Richard J. Larsen, Morris L. Marx
    
    Prerequisite: Know some multivariate calculus and comfortable with proof
    
    Another good first proof writing course and lighter than abstract algebra.

    Math stats make sense of why statistic is applied in that way. For example, why normal distribution is everywhere? why chi-square distribution? why student-t distribtion? why F distribution?
    
    It is also helpful prerequisite to theoretical foundation of machine learning.
4. Linear Algebra
5. Mathematical Analysis
   1. Understanding Analysis - Stephen Abbott
   2. Calculus - Micheal Spivak
   3. Principle of Mathematical Analysis - Walter Rudin
   
   If there is more notorious than SICP, then it must be the Baby Rudin. 
   
   Mathematical Analysis is usually a first rigorous proof writing course for pure math as a weeb out course. It provides rigorous foundation of calculus.
6. Mathematical Logic
   1. Logic for Mathematician - A.G. Hamilton
   2. Introduction to Mathematical Logic - Elliot Mendelson
   
   These book covers GÃ¶del's incompleteness theorem.
