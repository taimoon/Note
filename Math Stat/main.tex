\section*{Preliminaries}
Math Stats (Mathematical Statistic) is hard because 
unlike previous math you learn are about applying, 
whereas the math stats is about writting and understanding proof. Yes, proof is hard becuase it is abstract and cumulative. In theoretical math, we starts from definitions and axioms, then deriving lemmas, theorems and corollaries.
