\section{Hypergeometric Distribution}

\newcommand*{\permute}[2]{{}^{#1}P_{#2}}
Consider an experiment of drawing $n$ balls from an urn containing $N$ balls, withohut replacement. Suppose that balls are assigned integer consecutively. Then, an event of drawing $n$ balls from the urn can be characterized by a set whose elements correspond to a selection of $n$ elements from the total of $N$. For example,

\[
\left|\{8,1,4,9,5,41,56,\ldots, 88\}\right| = n
\]

Hence, there are $\binom{N}{n}$ of such set; set disregards order of elements.

Suppose that the same urn but contains contains $r$ red balls and $w$ balls, where $r+w=N$. Then the number of events that contain $k$ red balls and $(n-k)$ white balls in $n$ sample is

\[
\binom{r}{k}\binom{w}{n-k}  
\]

Hence, the probability of such event is

\[
P(k \text{ red balls are chosen}) = \frac{\binom{r}{k}\binom{w}{n-k}}{\binom{N}{n}}    
\]


\subsection{Hypergeometric is ``Orderless''}

Let say it is not set but $n$-tuple which order do matters. In other word, what is the probability of draw $n$ balls in order without replacement from a $N$ urn. The urn contains $r$ red balls and $w$ white balls. The probability of $k$ red balls in the sequence is:

\begin{align*}
    P(k \text{ red balls are picked}) 
    & = \frac{\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\cdot\permute{k}{r}\cdot\permute{w}{n-k}}{\permute{N}{n}} \\
    & = \frac{\frac{\permute{k}{r}}{k!}\cdot\frac{\permute{w}{n-k}}{(n-k)!}}{\permute{N}{n} \cdot \frac{1}{n!}} \\
    & = \frac{\binom{r}{k}\binom{w}{n-k}}{\binom{N}{n}} 
\end{align*}

Since $\binom{a}{b} = \frac{\permute{a}{b}}{b!}$
