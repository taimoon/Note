    "`for` here (unlike in `C`) is to iterate over something. For example, `range(n)` is a sequence starting from 0 until n-1, then the statement `for i in range(5)`, the `i` variable will walk to the next thing of the sequence for each iteration. Common idioms in using `for` will be presented implicitly through example. For now, we use `for` for convienence. This explaination is incomplete but enough for our purpose."
