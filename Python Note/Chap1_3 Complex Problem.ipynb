    "# Essence of Programming Languages\n",
    "\n",
    "In the very first chapter of the SICP book writes:\n",
    "> Thus,\n",
    "> when we describe a language, we should pay particular attention to the\n",
    "> means that the language provides for combining simple ideas to form\n",
    "> more complex ideas.\n",
    "> Every powerful language has three mechanisms for accomplishing this:\n",
    ">\n",
    ">**primitive expressions**, which represent the simplest entities the\n",
    "language is concerned with,\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **means of combination**, by which compound elements are built from simpler ones, and\n",
    ">\n",
    ">**means of abstraction**, by which compound elements can be named and manipulated as units.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the topic Python Basic, we can form expression from numbers and their operators to calculate another values. These numbers are primitve entities in Python. `string` is also an example that can be operated via concatenate operator to a longer `string`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Defining variable is also mean of abstraction, allow us to reference the entities via their names.\n",
    "\n",
    "`def` is the keyword in Python allow us to define program that can be else where. It is also mean of abstraction because we call other functions inside of a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, the notion of **combination** can be further explained in other way:\n",
    "1. One line statement or expression is a program, and multiple lines of these also a program. Combine program A and program B is still a program.\n",
    "2. The syntax of `if` is as followed:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "    if <expr>:\n",
    "        <prog>\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Note that this `if` form is also a program, hence insert `if` inside the `if` is still a program.\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    def main():\n",
    "        if x % 2 == 0:\n",
    "            print(f'{x} is even')\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    def main():\n",
    "        if x%3 == 0:\n",
    "            print(f'{x} is a multiple of 3')\n",
    "            if x % 2 == 0:\n",
    "                print(f'{x} is even') \n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Similarily, `if`-`elif`-`else`, `while`, `def` and `for` can also nest a program as above and program below.\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    def sum_of_multiples(a,b,n):\n",
    "        res = 0\n",
    "        while n > 0:\n",
    "            if n % a == 0 and n % b == 0:\n",
    "                res = res + n\n",
    "            n = n - 1\n",
    "        return res\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "3. We can call functions inside of a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lesson here is that in programming, **we build complex and big thing by combining simpler and smaller things.** \n",
    "To learn a new programming language or libraries, beside looking tutorial videos and documentations,\n",
    "we can be mindful on what are the underlying assumptions, fundamental entities and opartions that form the libraries or programming languages.\n",
    "Specifically, what are the primitives, the means of combination, and the means of abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, we can combine things using smaller things. \n",
    "- We can use repetitions and conditionals inside of the body beneathing conditional\n",
    "- We can use repetitions and conditionals inside of the body beneath repetition\n",
    "- We can define functions inside of the functions\n",
    "- We can call other functions at nearly anywhere of the code\n",
    "\n",
    "Footnote: \n",
    "1. The statement \"One line statement or expression is a program, and multiple lines of these also a program. Combine program A and program B is still a program.\" is same as the mathematical concept of *closure*\n",
    "2. Nest a program inside in another program sound like recursion. To many, recursion being counterintuitive concept. It is very convenient in parsing the grammar of formal langauges."

    "Every function does single thing, this is similar to the principle of single responsibility. Although looking at each of the functions itself seems trivial, they together can form the complex program. \n",

    "Here is some guidelines in designing functions and solving problem:\n",
    "1. Function suppress implementation details\n",
    "2. Function tends to generalize things\n",
    "3. **Consider required parameters, return values**\n",
    "4. Exploit the fact that arguments are local to the functions\n",
    "5. Exploit the fact that variables inside a function is local to the current function\n",
    "6. Code function over common patterns\n",
    "7. Functions can be called at nearly anywhere\n",
    "8. Consider functions to divide tasks\n",
    "9. Break down the problems into mutiple simpler problems or solve related problem first\n",
    "10. **Do some research, googling**\n"
