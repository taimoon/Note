    "Let consider a mathematical problem: Code a program that find greatest common divisor of two integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, we can google the code, copy the code, and run it. Even better, we can import the function from math, just use it.\n",
    "Thus in here, $gcd$ is used as an example for learning purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "In solving problem, we understand the problem first, and do some googling. In this case, we have to understand the notion of greatest common divisor. In this case, the greatest common divisor between two integers $a$ and $b$, denoted as $gcd(a,b)$. \n",
    "$d$ is a divisor of integer $a$ iff the remainder is 0 when $a$ is divided by $d$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the definition, we can try some examples. For example,\n",
    "- divisors of $12$ are $1,2,3,4,6,12$ \n",
    "- divisors of $18$ are $1,2,3,6,9,18$\n",
    "- $12$ and $18$ share mutiple common divisors $1,2,3,6$ but $6$ is the largest among them. \n",
    "- By definition, $gcd(12,18) = 6$\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, we often develop the program **incrementally**. We start from small and easy problem but related. \n",
    "For example, we try to code a program that find greatest common divisor of $12$ and $18$. \n",
    "It is also why we try to list out particular example in understanding the definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Observe that how we find greatest common divisor manually, we list out the divisors of two integers correspondingly, then search out the largest one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, this does not directly translate into a program. We can try further break down the problem. So let consider finding largest divisor of 18. The steps are as follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Generate all positive integers until 18 since any number larger than 18 cannot be divisor of 18.\n",
    "2. Test each positive integer if a divisor of 18\n",
    "3. Find the largest divisor but smaller than 18 since number always divide itself\n",
    "\n",
    "This do not directly solve even the particular problem, but it worth a try first. The code below is an idiom that update the largest during iteration. "
