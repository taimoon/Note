The use of `self.x` and `self.y` is to represent the Snake coordinate, and while Pong game use `Turtle` primitive to represent `ball`. To move a `Snake` or a `ball` given direction, one has to defined the x coordinate and y coordinate for each direction case. \n",

    "It is fine for simple game like this. What if doing these in developing 3D render library or Physic Simulation library which involve heavy use of linear algebra(matrix, coordinate, arithmetic), these x,y,z coordinates will scatter over the place. It would be more organizable if we abstract these as `Coordinate` or `Vector` type. This is data abstraction.\n",
