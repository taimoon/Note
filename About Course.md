This article mirros someone's thought about his university course. Don't expect it is useful.

# Background - Course Review

Syllabus that author's alma mater provide for data analytic:

In Malaysia, courses under 2u2i mode and other similiar variants either have extended internship period or internship interleaved with lectures or both. For the UMP's data analytic course, it includes one year of internship where its first half year is interleaved with online lectures and completing FYP and remaining half is usual internship.

My campus is not the main campus and where other engineering students at. Ironically, computer science students are at the main campus but my course faculty is not. This is because the course is designed by the Mathematical Science Center rather than Computer Science. Due to that, most of my lectures are statistician and few are mathematicians. 

The program is heavily mathematical oriented. Weirdly, the enrollment doesn't require students to has basic in Calculus and A-level equivalent Mathematics. Then, half of the enrolled students only have some basic (i.e.: Add-Math) or zero knowledge about mathemtics. Although they will gone through tuition class offered by my faculty, they still struggle in learning mathematical stuffs. The mathematics courses are really easy for those who have learnt; literally filler courses for them. I think that it can be done better.


## Language Courses
Language courses are just ... meh. By the way, I took German as foreign language course since I can speak,read and write Chinese so cannot take Chinese as foreign language. Sadly, I'm not literate enough to understand Deutsch. I also learn that many prominent figures in classical music, mathematics and philosophy are related to German.

## Common Courses
1. Softskills
2. Falsafah & Isu Semasa (Philosophy & Current Issues)
3. Technoprenuership 
4. Kokurikulum

These courses are compulsory taken by all Malaysia Government University in accordance to policies. They are badly delivered in my uni. No one like these. I learn nothing from these.

## Other Domains
1. Principles of Operation Management
2. Industry Quality Management

Principles of Operation Management does has a good textbook and that's the course. Quality course is a filler course.

## Mathematics
Most of the mathematics are statistics. Indeed, the essence of the program is to train statistcian but with knowledge of data science. A list of relevant course:

1. Discrete Mathematics
2. Mathematical Statistics (Theoretical foundation of Statistics, useful to ML)
3. Linear Algebra (Useful to ML) 
4. Applied Calculus (Multivariate Calculus, useful to ML)
5. Statistical Modelling (Useful to ML) 
6. Experimental Design Analysis (Extended Exercises for Math Stat)

## Programming and Data Science
1. Problem Solving (C)
2. Programming Techniques (C)
3. Data Structure and Algorithm (C)
4. DSP I (Python)
5. DSP II (R)
6. Database System (SQL)
7. Data Warehouse
8. Data Wrangling (filler) 
9. Data Mining (filler)
10. Introduction to Data Science (filler course)
11. Storytelling and Data Visualization (Tableau)
12. Artificial Intelligence (Python)

Problem solving is just another filler course.

Honestly, we didn't learn `C++` during DSA course but rather we stick to `C`. The DSA course is also badly taught. DSP I and II are introductions to `Python` and `R` with Data Science application and **open to other students**. 

Data wrangling is very badly taught but I don't know how it can be improved.


### Suggestions
Two sem of  `Python`. First sem is introduction to programming and other sem is data science application. 

DSA use either `Java` or `Python` to teach.

Database and Data warehouse can be combined.

Data Mining and Machine learning can be combined.

Data Wrangling should be taught better

Introduction to data science is just a waste of time.

Software engineering and system analysis design are more relevant than principles of operations management and industrial quality management. Though, students usually doesn't appreciate these much.

## Synergy

Operational Research, AI and DSA shares common goal is to **optimize** and sharing common set of techniques. It could be interesting if they are taught together.


# What I've learnt 
**The best education does not come to you; you have to search for it.**

The university does not teach me as much as I self taught myself using textbooks and tutorial videos. Great teaching is rare but a great book written by great teacher is not as rare as that. That's why I like textbooks.

Most of the courses are badly delivered so do not expect learn much. Their goal is to introduce there exists such a thing but its relevancy is questionable. For example, I wouldn't learn more about math stat if I don't know math stat exists. Therefore, always have a look on other programs' syllabus, you might decide to learn something new.
